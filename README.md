# vnet-building-block
A Terraform Module to configure a vnet connected to your central hub in your platform tenants. It can be used as a Building Block inside meshStack.

## Prerequisites

- A storage account for terraform state
- A service principal with permissions on the terraform state storage account and permissions to create resource groups and virtual networks

Here is an example terraform file for setting up the prerequesites:

```hcl
#
# storage for terraform state of service instances
#
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "unipipe_networking" {
  name                     = "unipipenetworkinglikvid"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.unipipe_networking.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.unipipe_networking.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "unipipe_networking" {
  name                 = "tfstates"
  storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.unipipe_networking.name
}

#
# Service Principal for managing service instances
#
resource "azuread_application" "unipipe_networking" {
  display_name = "unipipe-networking"
}

resource "azuread_service_principal" "unipipe_networking" {
  application_id = azuread_application.unipipe_networking.application_id
}

resource "azuread_service_principal_password" "unipipe_networking" {
  service_principal_id = azuread_service_principal.unipipe_networking.object_id
}

#
# Permissions for the Service Principal to manage service instances
#
resource "azurerm_role_definition" "resource_group_contributor" {
  name        = "resource_group_contributor"
  scope       = local.scope
  description = "A custom role that allows to manage resource groups. Used by Cloud Foundation automation."

  permissions {
    actions = [
      "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write",
      "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete",
      "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
    ]
  }

  assignable_scopes = [
    local.scope
  ]
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "resource_group_contributor" {
  scope              = local.scope
  role_definition_id = azurerm_role_definition.resource_group_contributor.role_definition_resource_id
  principal_id       = azuread_service_principal.unipipe_networking.id
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "networking_contributor" {
  scope                = local.scope
  role_definition_name = "Network Contributor"
  principal_id         = azuread_service_principal.unipipe_networking.object_id
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "unipipe_networking_backend" {
  scope                = azurerm_storage_account.unipipe_networking.id
  role_definition_name = "Contributor"
  principal_id         = azuread_service_principal.unipipe_networking.id
}
```

## How to use this module

Fork the repository and adapt `backend.tf`.
Create a service principal with the necessary permissions to 

Required inputs for this building block
1. all required variables that have no default value
2. the following environment variables need to be present: ARM_TENANT_ID (AAD tenant of the subscription of the terraform state storage account), ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID (subscription of the terraform state storage account), ARM_CLIENT_ID (service principal object id), ARM_CLIENT_SECRET (service principal secret)
